# Voiceline Challenge

Quickly set up a React app with bun (https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) which sets up a lyra (https://github.com/LyraSearch/lyra) DB with common JSON data like https://dummyjson.com/, you can have the lyra instance both on client or servers, does not matter. The React app should enable the user to search through the lyra instance and maybe display a search history. Try to follow best practices but do not overengineer it, stop at a maximum of 4 hours invested!
